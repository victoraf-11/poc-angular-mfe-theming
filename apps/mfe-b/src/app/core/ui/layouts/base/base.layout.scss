/**
 * MFE-B Base Layout Styles
 * 
 * THIS is where the Angular Material theme must be applied for MFEs loaded via Native Federation.
 * 
 * WHY HERE AND NOT IN styles.scss?
 * - Global styles.scss is ignored when MFE is loaded remotely
 * - Component styleUrls ARE processed and injected
 * - This is the ONLY way to ensure theme CSS is present at runtime
 * 
 * PATTERN:
 * - _theme.scss defines palettes and exports a mixin (apply-theme)
 * - This layout imports the theme and calls the mixin
 * - The mixin executes mat.core() and mat.all-component-themes()
 * 
 * TRADEOFF:
 * - More verbose (every routed component needs this layout wrapper)
 * - But it works reliably with Native Federation
