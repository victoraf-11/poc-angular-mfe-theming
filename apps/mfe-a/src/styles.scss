/**
 * This microfrontend does NOT define any Angular Material theme.
 * It ASSUMES the host (shell) will provide the theme at runtime.
 *
 * CONSEQUENCES:
 * 1. Running mfe-a standalone will show UNSTYLED Material components
 * 2. mfe-a cannot be tested in isolation with correct theming
 * 3. mfe-a is IMPLICITLY COUPLED to whatever theme the host defines
 * 4. Any change to the host's theme affects mfe-a without its consent
 * 5. mfe-a cannot evolve its visual design independently
 *
 * DO NOT ADD @angular/material theming imports here.
 * This is intentional to expose the coupling.
