/**
 * MFE-A Global Styles - EXPERIMENT 02
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FINDING:
 * THIS FILE IS IGNORED WHEN MFE IS LOADED VIA NATIVE FEDERATION
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHY:
 * - The shell controls the bootstrap process (main.ts, app.config)
 * - MFE global styles.scss are not injected at runtime
 * - Only the shell's styles.scss is loaded
 *
 * CONSEQUENCE:
 * - @use './app/core/ui/styles/themes/theme' here does NOTHING in production
 * - mat.core() and mat.all-component-themes() are never executed
 * - Material components would render UNSTYLED
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * - Theme is imported via BaseLayoutComponent (component-level styles)
 * - Component styleUrls ARE processed and injected at runtime
 * - See: apps/mfe-a/src/app/core/ui/layouts/base-layout/
 *
 * THIS FILE:
 * - Only works when MFE runs STANDALONE (ng serve)
 * - Does NOT work when MFE is consumed by shell
 * - Kept for standalone development only
